<li>First, library the three packages that would be used in this project: ggplot2, dplyr and scales. </li>
<li>Read the data and save it into rawds. Transform the data type of column date into Date class. </li>
<li>Finally add a new column on the right-most of the table called Weekdays, indicating the weekday of the date. This column will become crucial later.</li>

<p>As calculated above, the mean is 10766.19 and the median is 10765.</p>

<h2>What is the average daily activity pattern?</h2>

<p><strong>The code to process data:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>First, devide rawds into groups according to intervals (so there will be 60*24/5=288 groups).</li>
<li>Then calculate the average steps and save it in ids.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>The time series plot of the five-minute intervals</strong></p>

<p><strong>The code to find the interval with the most steps:</strong></p>

<pre><code class="r">ids[which.max(ids$AvgSteps),1]
</code></pre>

<pre><code>## Source: local data frame [1 x 1]
## 
##   interval
##      (int)
## 1      835
</code></pre>

<p>On average, the interval with most steps is 835, which is 8:35 a.m..</p>

<h2>Imputing missing values</h2>

<p><strong>Code for finding the number of total NAs and their distributions:</strong></p>

<pre><code class="r">sum(is.na(rawds$steps))
</code></pre>

<pre><code>## [1] 2304
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="r">rawds[is.na(rawds$steps),]-&gt;temp
table(temp$date)[table(temp$date)!=0]-&gt;temp
</code></pre>

<p>There are 2304 NAs.
2012-10-01, 2012-10-08, 2012-11-01, 2012-11-04, 2012-11-09, 2012-11-10, 2012-11-14 and 2012-11-30 equally have 288 NAs respectively. This shows that if a NA appears on any interval of a day, then other intervals will be NAs, too.</p>

<p>The main idea of the strategy is to find the weakday of each day with all NAs, and then replace those NAs with the average of each interval on that weekday. For example, 2012-10-01 is a Saturday and the steps on that day are all NAs. Then I will replace the NAs on 2012-10-01 with average steps of Monday.</p>
